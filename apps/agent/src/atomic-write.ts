 * Writes that go through a temporary file and a rename, so a reader or a

 * Windows refuses the rename while another process has the destination open:
 * a read of the file at that moment, an antivirus scan, the search indexer.
 * The refusal is EPERM, EBUSY or EACCES and lasts milliseconds, so the rename
 * is tried again a few times with a growing pause before it counts as failed.
 *
 * A store written from an event handler (the session store above all) must
 * never throw out of it: Studio runs inside the ue-mcp daemon, and an
 * exception there ends every session and the editor bridge with it.
 * PendingWrites keeps what could not be written in memory and writes it on the
